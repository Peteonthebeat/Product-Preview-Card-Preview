## My process

Usually, I first lay down all the HTML and then move to the CSS. Along with this I also upload all the fonts, and clear some browser defaults, which is also what I did for this challenge. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

First, I want to continue developing my skills with 'Flex' and 'Grid' and then move to the basics of JavaScript.
I plan to do this by doing the challenges on the Frontend Mentor website and spending the least time on tutorials.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas) - This helped me for get the whole idea of
  ordering the areas visually.
- [Resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_grid-template-areas) - This actually helped me figure out what exactly I needed for both of my media declarations.
